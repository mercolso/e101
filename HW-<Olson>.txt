a. Mercedes Olson      mercolso@umail.iu.edub. Engineering is innovation and designs of projects of different sizes that impacts many people to make life or a task quicker, easier, or more efficient. The engineers themselves utilize what they have around them all while making new discoveries. c. Intelligent system engineering takes systems to make a device more efficient both in size and in power. ISE leads to new waves of development and ideas in technology which in turns helps many categories of people. d. While I am an engineer in ISE I would like to accomplish making a prototype of something that has the potential to be life changing that can help many people. While I have no ideas for what that could be at the moment I would also like to improve and learn how to collaborate with others. e. Characteristics and skills that would be necessary include having drive, creativity, flexibility, the ability to work with others, math/physics understanding. One of the biggest characteristics to me would be the desire to want to make a difference with what your ideas, progress towards them, and creating it, brings to the table.
